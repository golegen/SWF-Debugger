SWF-Debugger
============

Flash app for testing SWF Activity Module environment and services

Developed and built using the free and open source FlashDevelop
ActionScript and Apache Flex IDE.
See: http://www.flashdevelop.org/
There isn't a decent Actionscript IDE for Linux yet. Sorry!

Works with the SWF Activity Module for Moodle
See: https://github.com/matbury/SWF-Activity-Module2.5

Set the compiler output to your Moodle's /mod/swf/swfs/ directory.
e.g. C:\\wamp\public_html\moodle\mod\swf\swfs\swf_activity_module_debugger.swf

Functions:

* Loads and displays SMIL and XML files
* Lists and inspects individual SMIL <seq> nodes
* Loads and displays/plays multimedia
* Pushes example grades to Moodle's grade book
* Saves screen shots to moodledata and pushes grades with screen shots embedded
in feedback column.
